Forking a repository creates a personal copy of someone else's project.
Cloning the forked repository allows you to work on it locally.
Creating a new branch is a best practice to encapsulate your changes.
Committing and pushing your changes updates your forked repository.
Creating a pull request allows the original project maintainers to review and merge your changes.
